# Customer Churn Prediction Using Artificial Neural Networks (ANN)

## Overview

This project aims to predict customer churn using Artificial Neural Networks (ANN). Customer churn prediction is crucial for businesses to identify and retain customers who might be leaving, allowing them to implement strategies to improve customer satisfaction and reduce attrition.


## Steps

### 1. Data Collection

- Gather historical customer data, including features like demographics, usage patterns, purchase history, etc.
- Ensure the dataset includes a target variable indicating whether the customer churned or not.

### 2. Data Preprocessing

- **Load Data**: Read the dataset using Pandas or similar libraries.
- **Data Cleaning**: Handle missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies.
- **Feature Engineering**: Create new features if necessary and encode categorical variables.
- **Normalization/Standardization**: Scale numerical features to ensure all features contribute equally to the model.

### 3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

- **Data Visualization**: Plot graphs to understand the distribution of features and target variable.
- **Correlation Analysis**: Check correlations between features and the target variable.

### 4. Model Building

- **Split Data**: Divide the dataset into training and testing sets.
- **Define Model**: Create an ANN model using libraries like TensorFlow or PyTorch. Specify the number of layers, activation functions, and neurons.
- **Compile Model**: Choose an optimizer, loss function, and metrics for evaluation.
- **Train Model**: Fit the model to the training data and evaluate its performance on the validation set.

### 5. Model Evaluation

- **Metrics**: Evaluate the model using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC-ROC.
- **Confusion Matrix**: Analyze the confusion matrix to understand the model's performance in classifying churn and non-churn customers.

### 6. Model Tuning

- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Adjust hyperparameters like learning rate, batch size, and the number of epochs to improve performance.
- **Cross-Validation**: Use cross-validation to ensure the model generalizes well to unseen data.

### 7. Predictions

- **Make Predictions**: Use the trained model to predict churn probabilities on new data.
- **Interpret Results**: Analyze the predicted probabilities to identify high-risk customers.
